# Project 3: LCD Game
# Nicole Torres



The video game I attempted to make was Pong.

The game consists of:
-A ball
-2 player paddles
-A score count

This game is for 2 players and the first player to reach to the score of 3 is the
winner. The ball makes a sound every time a collision occurs.


Once there is a winner that player is displayed on the screen.


Then the game ends.
